## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Temperature monitoring** - May not work on all hardware
2. **Network connections** - May require root on some systems
3. **Mouse clicking** - Basic implementation (can be refined)
4. **Process filter** - No keyboard shortcut yet (implementation ready)

These are minor limitations that don't affect core functionality.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Not Critical)

The following were identified but not critical for v2.0:

1. Process management (kill/renice)
2. Export to CSV/JSON
3. Process tree view
4. Theme customization
5. Remote monitoring
6. Container awareness
7. GPU monitoring
8. System service status

These can be added in future versions based on user feedback.
